- 👋 Hi, I’m @rcmcreativedesign
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and learning new languages and technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ...

I've been developing software professionally for about 20 years. I've been almost exclusively programming for the .NET platform 
doing Winforms and ASP.NET programming (both VB.NET and C#), but recently I've been branching out learning Android, C, and PHP.

My current project is a PHP-based site that allows you to share pictures with friends and family.
